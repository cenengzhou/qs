							but have a limited vocabulary. Syntactic matchers provide more
							precision, but may sacrifice performance, robustness, or power.
							To achieve more of the benefits of both models, we extend the
							pattern syntax of AWK to support matching of abstract syntax
							trees, as demonstrated in a tool called TAWK. Its pattern syntax
							is language-independent, based on abstract tree patterns. As in
							AWK, patterns can have associated actions, which in TAWK are
							written in this for generality, familiarity, and performance. The
							use of this is simplified by high-level libraries and dynamic
							linking. To allow processing of program files containing
							non-syntactic constructs such as textual macros, mechanisms have
							been designed that allow matching of ""language-like" macros in a
							syntactic fashion
